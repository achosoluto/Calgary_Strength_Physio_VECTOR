## Phase 1: Protection & Activation (Weeks 0-2)

### 1. Clinical Rationale
The primary goal in the immediate post-operative phase is to minimize arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) and restore full passive extension. AMI is a presynaptic reflex inhibition of the quadriceps muscle that prevents full voluntary activation.

**Key Risks:**
*   **Cyclops Lesion:** Failure to achieve full extension early can lead to scar tissue formation in the intercondylar notch.
*   **Graft Failure:** The BPTB graft is strongest at day 0 but undergoes necrosis and revascularization (ligamentization) over the next 12 months. Open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises place high shear force on the graft and must be avoided in early phases.

### 2. Exit Criteria (The Gate)
To progress to Phase 2 (Strengthening), the client *must* meet:
*   **Quad Lag:** 0° (Full active terminal knee extension)
*   **Knee Extension:** Equal to contralateral side (typically 0° or hyperextension)
*   **Pain:** ≤ 2/10 on NPRS during exercises
*   **Effusion:** Trace or less (Stroke Test Grade 0-1)

## 3. Programming Logic

### A. Quad Activation
**Intent:** Restore voluntary motor unit recruitment in the rectus femoris and vastus medialis.

**Standard Exercise: Quad Set (Isometric)**
*   **Dosage:** 10 reps × 10s hold, hourly.
*   **Cue:** "Push the back of your knee into the towel. Lift your heel."

**High-Density Option: NMES (Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation)**
*   **Rationale:** Voluntary contraction alone cannot overcome AMI. NMES bypasses the inhibited spinal reflex loop to depolarize motor nerves directly.
*   **Evidence:** Hauger et al. (2024) demonstrated a 23% greater quadriceps strength retention at 6 weeks with NMES vs. voluntary exercise alone in ACLR patients.
*   **Settings:**
    *   Waveform: Biphasic Pulsed or Russian Protocol
    *   Frequency: 50-75 Hz (Type II fiber recruitment)
    *   Pulse Duration: 200-400 μs
    *   Intensity: Max tolerance (visible tetanic contraction)
    *   Duty Cycle: 1:3 to 1:5 (e.g., 10s on, 50s off)
*   **Contraindications:** Pacemakers, pregnancy, superficial metal implants, open wounds.

### B. Range of Motion (Extension Bias)
**Intent:** Prevent extension deficit (flexion contracture).

**Standard Exercise: Prone Hang / Heel Prop**
*   **Dosage:** Total end-range time (TERT) of 60 minutes/day.
*   **Logic:** Low-load, long-duration stretching is superior for connective tissue remodeling (creep).
